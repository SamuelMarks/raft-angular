## Raft-Angular

This project is about depicting the concepts of **RAFT** with the help of a user interface. If you are wondering what exactly **RAFT** is, i recommend this [link](https://raft.github.io) for a good grasp on inner workings of the protocol. Briefly explaining, this protocol is about how you can build your own distributed `cache/datastore` with concepts which are intuitive and reasonable as compared to other similar systems such as **Paxos**. You can think of it as TCP/IP for data communications. The choice of framework for developing the UI is Angular 4.
